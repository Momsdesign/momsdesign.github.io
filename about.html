        <p class="about-text">Hello
            <br>I’m Mohamed, a digital designer currently studying
            <br>Digital Design at Yrgo in Gothenburg.
            <br>
            <br> My most recent worklife experience before Yrgo 
            <br> was as a supervisor at Volvo Cars.
            <br>I have a great interest in working with and around 
            <br>people. 
            <br>
            <br>Becoming a digital designer is my way to
            <br>continue keep doing what I’m best at with a new 
            <br>set of skills and a new toolset.
            <br>
            <br>My biggest passions in life are music, film, cooking
            <br>and the human encounter. Combining all of this 
            <br>togheter is what I want to do when i grow up.
            <br>
            <br>I’m 29 and still believe we all have a long way 
            <br>until we completely grow up.</p>
